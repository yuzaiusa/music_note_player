Playing a single voice of melody could be boring. Adding another voice and employing
harmonies could significantly increase the depth of the music.

In this excercise, we will take a deep dive into a building block of the previous exercises,
the play_frequency function, and make it more flexible so that we can play multiple notes at the
same time, and also use different waveforms to generate different sounds.
